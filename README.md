# Udacity-Explore_Weather_Trends
Project 1 : Udacity : Data Analyst Nanodegree

Summary
In this project, you will analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature
trends where I live(i.e New Delhi) to overall global temperature trends.

Overview:
I have been provided the temperature database from the portal from where I have extracted
the data related to global temperature and my city temperature. I analyzed the temperature
around the global with the city I live by extracting the data from the database.

Goals :
1. Selecting city and country from the database “city_list”.
2. Extracting the City level data from the database “city_data” and export to CSV file.
3. Extracting the global temperature from the database “global_data” and export to CSV file.

Final OBSERVATIONS :
1. Global Average Temperature for 10 yr MA varies between 8.5°C to 9.5°C
2. New Delhi city Average Temperature for 10 yr MA varies between 23.5°C to 26.7°C
3. The Chart of New Delhi Vs Global has very big difference in the temperatures.
4. If comparison is made between Global and New Delhi Average Temperatures Bangalore is
hotter than global average temperature .
5. The final conclusion of this project is New Delhi is hotter than global temperature
and temperature is increasing day by day due to changes in the climate
